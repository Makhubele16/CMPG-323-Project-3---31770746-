# Overview
In today's world, with millions of applications in use, developers' ability to read and understand code is more crucial than ever. To demonstrate this, I was given an existing ASP.NET Core MVC application to enhance and improve.

I applied architectural patterns and adhered to the SOLID principles to improve the application's design, maintainability, and scalability. Specifically, I:

Separated concerns by isolating the application's different layers, such as the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer.
Encapsulated business logic in classes and interfaces, making it easier to reuse and test.
Used dependency injection to decouple components and make the code more flexible.
Followed the SOLID principles to ensure that the code was well-designed, modular, and easy to maintain.
As a result of my efforts, the application is now more robust, efficient, and easier to scale as needed.
